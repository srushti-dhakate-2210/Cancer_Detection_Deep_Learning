# SkinGenics - An application to classify your cancerious lesions into benign and malignant

## <a href="https://skingenics.netlify.app/" >View Deployment</a>

## SkinGenics helps you to predict your skin cancer between Benign and Malignant. It integrates Deep Learning technology with your deviceâ€™s camera to help you capture and analyse skin lesions with more than 96% accuracy

`Please Note: This application is built for learning purpose `

# How it Works
SkinGenics is a Skin-Cancer prediction application that uses CNN and Deep learning technology to calculate the probability that a skin lesions is Benign or Malignant, by comparing its appearance to thousands of other lesion images. SkinGenics has more than 96% accuracy

1. Upload Picture of Your Skin Lesion

2. SkinGenics will compare it with thousands of similar lesion images

3. SkinGenics will predict the class of cancer
