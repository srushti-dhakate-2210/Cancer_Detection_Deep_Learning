# SkinGenics - An application to classify your cancerious lesions into benign and malignant

## <a href="https://skingenics.netlify.app/" >View Deployment</a>

## SkinGenics helps you to predict your skin cancer between Benign and Malignant. It integrates Deep Learning technology with your device’s camera to help you capture and analyse skin lesions with more than 96% accuracy

`Please Note: This application is built for learning purpose `

# How it Works
SkinGenics is a Skin-Cancer prediction application that uses CNN and Deep learning technology to calculate the probability that a skin lesions is Benign or Malignant, by comparing its appearance to thousands of other lesion images. SkinGenics has more than 96% accuracy

1. Upload Picture of Your Skin Lesion

2. SkinGenics will compare it with thousands of similar lesion images

3. SkinGenics will predict the class of cancer
